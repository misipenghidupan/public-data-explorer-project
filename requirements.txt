# NOTE: The dependency 'djongo' was likely installed via pip and is crucial. 
# While its version is not explicitly listed in the conda section of the YML, 
# it must be included for the project to function. A placeholder version is used 
# above; use 'pip freeze' on your active environment for the precise version.
